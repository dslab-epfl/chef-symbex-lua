This is Lua 5.2.2, modified to be run in a Chef environment

Setting up the Chef environment
-------------------------------

The Lua environment is set up automatically using the "Makefile.chef" file.

We assume the following project structure for setting up Chef:

$CHEF_ROOT
  - s2e (S2E + the Chef core)
  - lua-src (the Lua code base -- this tree)

Create a $CHEF_ROOT/lua-src/build directory, and run the following
inside the new directory:

$ make -f ../Makefile.chef

You can then use the "lua_runner.py" script to execute Lua scripts:

$ ./lua_runner.py targets/test_json_concrete.lua
$ LUASYMBEX=1 ./lua_runner.py targets/test_json_sym.lua

In addition, the LUASYMBEXOPT environment variable controls the
symbolic optimization levels.  Currently, they are "lua-noopt" and
"lua-opt" (default).
